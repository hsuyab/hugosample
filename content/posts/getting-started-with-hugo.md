### Hugo Directory Structure

```
my-site/
├── archetypes/          # Content templates
├── assets/              # Global assets
├── content/             # Your content files
├── data/                # Data files
├── layouts/             # Template files
├── static/              # Static files
├── themes/              # Themes
└── hugo.toml           # Configuration file
```

### Configuration

Hugo uses a configuration file (hugo.toml, hugo.yaml, or hugo.json) to customize your site. Here are some important settings:

```yaml
baseURL: 'https://example.org/'
languageCode: 'en-us'
title: 'My Awesome Blog'
theme: 'PaperMod'

params:
  author: 'Your Name'
  description: 'My awesome blog description'
  keywords: ['blog', 'tech', 'programming']
```

### Content Management

Hugo uses front matter to manage content metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post Title"
date: 2023-12-01
draft: false
tags: ["hugo", "tutorial"]
categories: ["blog"]
---
```

### Next Steps

Once you have Hugo set up:

1. Customize your theme
2. Add more content
3. Configure SEO settings
4. Deploy to a hosting provider

### Conclusion

Hugo is an excellent choice for building fast, secure, and maintainable websites. Its learning curve is gentle, and the documentation is comprehensive. Start with a simple blog and gradually explore its more advanced features.

Happy blogging with Hugo!
